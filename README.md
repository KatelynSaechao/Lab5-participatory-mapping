# Mapping Nature Experiences in Seattle

Created by Katelyn Saechao

The map can be accessed [HERE](https://katelynsaechao.github.io/Lab5-participatory-mapping/).

The target audience for this map was nature lovers or people who are out in nature often. I created this participatory map with the purpose of allowing people to describe their experiences out in nature. 

To get started, click the location on the map and simply enter your name, email, the date and time you visited this nature location, and your description of your experience at this place in nature. Then, click the submit button to add your submission to the map! To read the experiences on the map, hover your mouse over the tree location marker!
